# Manifesto in favor of Open Source Hardware in the mobility sector
* Initial version written on May 28, 2021 *
*English version*

* By signing the Paris Agreement, France, with the support of companies, has committed to reducing its GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 to actively fight against climate change. Transport is the primary cause of these emissions, so it is essential to initiate a strong, rapid and innovative transformation. Open source hardware can be one solution. Indeed, driven by the acceleration of the transition to electricity, the world of mobility is now experiencing changes of an absolutely unprecedented scale (modular approach, prevalence of use, extreme diversification of products and solutions …) Which require both increased collaboration and the invention of new models of value creation. We are convinced that open source hardware is a particularly relevant approach to meet these challenges, as evidenced by the astonishing growth it is currently experiencing. By leveraging the power and responsiveness of communities, open source shows that it can innovate often more effectively than companies do within a closed ecosystem of partners. In a context where barriers to entry tend to disappear, it is indeed the ability to animate and bring together communities that becomes key, much more than the place one occupies in the value chain. *

Beyond the Linux operating system, the Firefox browser or the now essential LibreOffice suite, thousands of open source solutions are used by businesses on a daily basis. In fact, far from being a libertarian and utopian movement, open source is above all an innovation process as effective as it is pragmatic, which has become central in the software economy and more broadly in the digital economy (1). The main reason is the ability of open source to be a tremendous lever for creating value, as each demonstrated in their own way by Google or Huawei to name a few.

The idea here is not to make a naive apology for the open source model, much less to predict its inevitable advent to the detriment of the usual industrial property logic, supported by the patent system. The two models are, in our opinion, quite complementary. But, until now little developed in the industrial world, open source seems to us to be a particularly relevant approach to meet the challenges posed by the transition to new forms of mobility.

These challenges are now well known and are notably marked by a twofold evolution:
- ** The digitization ** of the transport sector has accelerated and the implementation of 5G will amplify the phenomenon. In the future, vehicles will be in permanent communication with their environment, be it infrastructure networks, but also mobility operators and of course users, hence the need for close cooperation and depth between a wide variety of actors.
- ** The electrification ** of vehicles will experience considerable growth over the next decade, supported by now mature technologies, a strong political commitment to reduce GHGs and the ever more assertive citizen demand for soft mobility and respectful of the environment. However, the design, production and use of electric vehicles call for major innovations that break with the logic that has prevailed until then and which will have a strong impact on the creation of value. Let us quote two of them:
    - Like computers, electric vehicles are increasingly designed around “modules” called ** technological bricks **. This means that the stake and therefore the added value does not lie so much in the ability to produce these bricks, as in arranging and assembling them so as to be able to configure vehicles that are much more diversified and adapted to the users than they are today.
    - The ** prevalence of use ** is derived from the modular approach. The challenge tomorrow will be to continuously improve the vehicle (like airliners), through predictive maintenance, the replacement of defective parts and the recycling of these parts and materials. In fact, it will favor business models built on maximizing usage and services, rather than those based on ownership.

These changes, of considerable magnitude, are fraught with consequences as well as opportunities. They open up a prodigious field of innovation for a number of players, whether or not they are native to mobility. But they also imply a reinvention of value creation models, at the same time as increased collaboration between actors. 

However, we are touching here on what characterizes open source in its own right. A collaborative and decentralized mode of development, open source relies on the power and responsiveness of communities to solve problems with much more efficiency, but also reliability than companies would do with their only resources, or even in closed ecosystems. However, opening up to communities must be done in a logic where everyone wins: to put it another way, what each contributes must allow others to create enough value so that, in return, they do the same. And so on. Without this elementary principle of reciprocity which by definition excludes stowaways, no open source ecosystem will be able to function sustainably.

The current context of transition to new forms of mobility offers market situations in which the choice of open source has considerable advantages:
* The opportunity to mobilize a ** enlarged and complex ecosystem ** (between industrial players from different backgrounds, but also the world of research, organizing authorities, end users, associations, etc.): the openness, in addition to pooling skills and resources, is here a way of gradually, almost step by step, the most relevant ecosystem and the best suited to the innovations developed.
* The need to ** test, experiment ** technologies upstream of their industrialization: this can be done by relying on partners, communities and users much more quickly, reliably and economical than if these same developments were carried out in a closed circuit).
* The need to align with ** technological norms and standards **: the open source approach, unlike a defensive approach through patents, encourages rapid adoption by a large number of actors of the same standard (like the Arduino prototyping platform). This then provides the guarantee of making the right technological choices, at least those which will prevail because they will be adopted by enough players to create a critical mass and thus allow scaling up, the key to reduction of production costs and therefore the promise of better competitiveness of products and solutions, once on the market. In addition, this facilitates the subsequent approval of solutions not provided for by regulatory texts, a very common scenario for any breakthrough innovation.
* The interest, echoing the prevalence of use, in encouraging the diversification of products: the opening of their interfaces by the players facilitates the development of a wide variety of low-volume products, a situation which already corresponds to part to that of manufacturers inviting vehicle body builders to design specific fittings on some of their vehicles, but which will gain considerable scope with the rise of mobility operators.

Open source will have a different impact on the various players in the mobility value chain:
* It offers a central position to mobility operators whether private or public and who, as contractors, can define precise specifications concerning the mobility solutions they expect and this, beyond the offer proposed by the manufacturers.
* Manufacturers, in fact, have tended over the decades to build closed systems, like real fortresses, in order to better define their perimeter of liability (* liability *) (2) and also, incidentally, to make their customers captives. But these closed systems are proving to be irrelevant, or even not very conducive to innovation, as the market as a whole is undergoing a revolution of unprecedented magnitude which, conversely, requires increased collaboration between the various players. They will certainly keep a central place as assemblers, but tomorrow they will no longer be the only ones to put finished products on the market. They will have to rethink their profession, reinvent different axes of value.
* Equipment manufacturers, for their part, are offered new perspectives, particularly those of moving up the value chain, diversifying their outlets, or even designing finished or semi-finished products themselves.
* Last but not least, open source breaks down a number of barriers to entry and allows new players to venture onto playgrounds that were previously off limits to them. The possibility of relying on an existing base of knowledge, which may eventually become so many commodities, is a remarkable lever for accelerating competitiveness at the same time as an injunction to find new axes of value creation.

As we can see, the question is no longer knowing what place you occupy in the value chain, but rather being able to fit into partner ecosystems, or even organize them around yourself. This is clearly the approach Baidu followed through the Apollo project and which, in just a few years, has allowed it to assert itself as a major player in the autonomous vehicle. This is also the meaning of the MIH Alliance, recently created by Foxconn and which aims to be a platform promoting innovation and development around electric vehicles.

Without being a miracle solution, open source poses a number of problems, first and foremost of which is the establishment of a business model that is profitable to all within a framework that preserves equity and reciprocity. . The prospect of open collaborations also supposes a complex and sometimes painful work of acculturation which often represents a major obstacle for companies which have made industrial property sacred for decades.
In addition, open source practices are revolutionizing ways of thinking but also calling into question working methods. In particular, by promoting the participation of heterogeneous actors coming from different disciplines (natural sciences, techniques or human sciences, etc.) the tools, codes, standards of development must evolve to integrate these new actors. Like Germany, which develops standards to facilitate collaboration and ensure the quality of development processes [DIN SPEC 3105](https://gitlab.com/OSEGermany/OHS-3105), there is a real challenge to be taken up to allow the spread of open source approaches beyond a circle of convinced pioneers.

However, in our opinion, it is advisable to take open source for what it is, namely a formidable opportunity to accelerate innovation by relying on the strength of partner ecosystems and this, with a great economy of means and a best guarantee of success. Open source, particularly effective in responding to the immense challenges raised by the transition to sustainable mobility, is finally all the more relevant as it resonates with the civic aspirations marked, with regard to companies, by the expectation of increased transparency, respect for strong and unifying values or more marked commitments to serve the common good. If zero-emission mobility constitutes today this common horizon capable of federating the 4Cs (* Companies, Countries, Cities and Civil Society *), open source offers, we are convinced, the best framework capable of enabling rapid and efficient deployment.


** By signing this text, we make the following commitments: **
* we recall our commitment to reducing GHGs in transport.
* we recognize the relevance of open source (hardware AND software) in our business / activity as a tool and approach to transform mobility so that it becomes more sustainable.
* We are committed to allowing our teams to train and develop skills in the design, development and management of open source projects.
* We are committed, collectively and individually, to fostering the emergence of open source within our organizations and our ecosystem.
